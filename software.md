## Libraries

* **[Neuropythy](https://github.com/noahbenson/neuropythy)** is a Python library that is intended to
  build on the existing [nibabel](http://nipy.org/nibabel/) library. Neuropythy provides easy access
  to anatomical data stored in FreeSurfer subject directories, and provides numerous utilities for
  reading, interpolating, and registering cortical data, especially retinotopic mapping data.

* **[Neurotica](https://github.com/noahbenson/Neurotica)** is a Mathematica library that serves much
  the same purpose as Neuropythy, but for Wolfram Mathematica.
* **[SCO](https://github.com/WinawerLab/sco)** is a Python library for predicting the BOLD response
  in an arbitrary brain (e.g., from a T1 file) to an arbitrary stimulus image (e.g., a PNG file).
* **[nben](https://github.com/noahbenson/nben)** is a Java and Clojure library that contains both a
  mix of handy clojure definitions as well as some mathematical and optimization libraries in
  Java. This library is used by both Neuropythy and Neurotica to perform mesh registration.
* **[pimms](https://github.com/noahbenson/pimms)** is a Python library that enables various kinds of
  immutable data support; both immutable calculation pipelines and immutable classes.
