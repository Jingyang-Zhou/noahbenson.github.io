#### [Predicting neuronal dynamics with a delayed gain control model (Zhou et al. 2019. *PLoS Comp Bio.*)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6892546/pdf/pcbi.1007484.pdf) ####

We provide a simple and feed-forward model of neuronal dynamics that incorporates brief time-scale (contrast) gain control.

#### [Compressive temporal summation in human visual cortex (Zhou et al. 2018. *J Neurosci.*)](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/38/3/691.full.pdf) ####

Using fMRI, we measured and modeled populational neuronal response over time, in a collection of visually responses brain areas.
