I work as a postdoc in visual neuroscience at NYU, in Eero Simoncelli's [Lab for Computational Vision](https://www.cns.nyu.edu/~lcv/). I have a computational and theoretical interest of course, but in general, I try to understand anything I encounter, and figured this is an implementable and sustainable way of living a fulfilling life for me.

* For more information about my research, see [Research]({{site.baseurl}}/research/) page or my [CV]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/ZhouCV_2020April.pdf). 

* [Software]({{site.baseurl}}/software/) consists of a bunch of computational tools that I built that helped my own research. The hope is that they may serve people with similar needs. 

* My blog posts on various scientific topics are [here]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/).
