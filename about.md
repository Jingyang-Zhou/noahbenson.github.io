I'm a PhD candidate in the [Winawer Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/winawerlab/) at
New York University. I study visual neuroscience and explore how visual information is transformed at different stages of cortical processing. For more information about my research, see my
[Research]({{site.baseurl}}/research/) page or my [Curriculum
Vitae]({{site.baseurl}}/cv/).
