I work in visual neuroscience at NYU, and I have more than just a computational interest. 

* For more information about my research, see my [Research]({{site.baseurl}}/research/) page or my [CV]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/ZhouCV_2020April.pdf). 

* [Software]({{site.baseurl}}/software/) consists of a bunch of computational tools that I built over the years for my own research, could be helpful to you too. 

* My blog posts on various scientific topics are [here]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/).
