I'm a research scientist in the [Winawer Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/winawerlab/) at
[New York University](http://www.nyu.edu/). I study vision and its neural
correlates with particular interests in how the anatomical structure of the
brain is related to visual experience and computation. For more information
about my research, see my [Research]({{site.baseurl}}/research/) page.
