My research interest is reasonably broad. Like many people at this time in history of visual research, I want to build layered networks that resemble the brain, and conceptualize what the brain does. My approach, at the moment, is to make abstractions from our better-understood low-level vision. This is because for the moment I want to test and practice my fundamentals.
