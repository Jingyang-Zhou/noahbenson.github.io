### [Predicting neuronal dynamics with a delayed gain control model](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6892546/pdf/pcbi.1007484.pdf) ### 

We provide a simple and feed-forward model of neuronal dynamics that incorporates contrast-dependent gain control.

### [Compressive temporal summation in human visual cortex](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/38/3/691.full.pdf) ### 

Using fMRI, we measured and modeled neuronal populations' temporal response in a collection of visually responses brain areas.
